Generate a Nuclei template in YAML format to detect a vulnerability based on the provided CVE ID and description. The template should include an HTTP GET request with a payload tailored to the vulnerability type (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) and appropriate matchers to identify the vulnerability. Use the CVE ID in the template's 'id' field and include the description in the 'info' section. Return only the YAML code, no additional explanations. Hereâ€™s an example:

```yaml
id: CVE-EXAMPLE-1234
info:
  name: Example SQL Injection
  author: yourname
  severity: high
  description: Detects SQL Injection in a vulnerable endpoint.
  reference:
    - https://example.com
  tags: cve, sql-injection
requests:
  - method: GET
    path:
      - "{{BaseURL}}/vulnerable.php?id=1' OR '1'='1"
    matchers:
      - type: word
        words:
          - "SQL syntax error"
          - "mysql_fetch"
        part: body
        condition: or
```

Now, generate a template for CVE ID: {cve_id}, Description: {description}
